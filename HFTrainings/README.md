Masked Language Model Training and Evaluation:

This Python script trains and evaluates a masked language model using the CodeBERT model. It leverages the Hugging Face Transformers library for model loading, tokenization, and training. The training and evaluation process is accelerated using the Accelerator from the accelerate library.

Requirements
Python 3.x
PyTorch
Hugging Face Transformers
accelerate

To run the script, execute the following command:

python your_script.py -train <train_size> -valid <valid_size> -test <test_size>

Replace <train_size>, <valid_size>, and <test_size> with the desired sizes for the training, validation, and test datasets, respectively.

Description of the Script
Argument Parsing: The script uses the argparse module to parse command-line arguments for specifying the sizes of the training, validation, and test datasets.

Dataset Loading: It loads the Java datasets from the CodeSearchNet repository using the load_dataset function from the datasets library. The datasets are split into training, validation, and test sets according to the specified sizes.

Tokenization: The script tokenizes the dataset using the CodeBERT model's tokenizer obtained from the Hugging Face model hub.

Data Preparation: It prepares the dataset by concatenating sequences into chunks and creating a labels column for the masked language modeling task.

Model Initialization: The pretrained CodeBERT model for masked language modeling is loaded using the AutoModelForMaskedLM class from the Hugging Face library.

Training Loop: The script trains the model for a specified number of epochs using the training dataset. It utilizes an AdamW optimizer and a linear learning rate scheduler. The training progress is monitored using a progress bar.

Evaluation: After each epoch, the model's performance is evaluated on the test dataset. The loss, perplexity, and entropy metrics are calculated and printed.

Saving Models: The trained model is saved to the specified output directory using the save_pretrained method.

Masked Language Model Prediction: The script uses the trained model to predict the masked token in a sample text. It calculates the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) based on the scores obtained from the model predictions.

Results Analysis: The MRR is computed and printed to evaluate the model's performance.
